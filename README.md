# WordPress to Bludit converter
Converts the wordpress database xml file to the bludit's data structure

It converts Pages, Posts, tags, featured images, captions on images, Video/Twitter links to embed codes and creates an xml file 
with the comments if needed (for disqus). It doesnâ€™t convert galleries though. 

You can select if you want to convert media url (Facebook videos, Vimeo, Youtube, Dailymotion videos and Tweets) to embed code 
or leave them as they are.
